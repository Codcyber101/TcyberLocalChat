# OpenSpec Change Proposal: Analyze and Configure Frontend UI

## Title
Analyze and Configure Frontend UI

## Description
This proposal outlines the steps to analyze the current frontend project structure and configuration. The goal is to ensure the frontend is correctly set up for development, including a review of dependencies, scripts, and the Next.js configuration. This will establish a solid foundation for future feature development.

## Analysis
Based on the initial review of the `frontend` directory, here's what we know:

*   **Framework:** The frontend is a Next.js application.
*   **UI Components:** The project uses `shadcn-ui` and `radix-ui` for UI components, which suggests a component-based architecture.
*   **Styling:** `tailwindcss` is used for styling.
*   **Dependencies:** Key dependencies include `react`, `next`, `tailwindcss`, and various `radix-ui` components.
*   **Configuration:** 
    *   `next.config.ts` is set up with a rewrite rule for API requests to `http://localhost:3001`.
    *   Environment variables `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` are defined.
*   **Testing:** `jest` is set up for testing, but there are no tests yet.
*   **Linting:** `eslint` is configured.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Create a Comprehensive `README.md`
A detailed `README.md` is crucial for onboarding and consistency.

*   **Action:** Create `frontend/README.md`.
*   **Contents:**
    *   Project overview and purpose.
    *   Prerequisites (e.g., Node.js version).
    *   Instructions for installing dependencies (`npm install`).
    *   Instructions for running the development server (`npm run dev`).
    *   Explanation of available scripts (`build`, `start`, `lint`, `test`).
    *   Details on environment variables.

### 2. Add `.env.example`
To make environment variable management clear, we should add an example file.

*   **Action:** Create `frontend/.env.example`.
*   **Contents:**
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=TcyberChatbot
    ```

### 3. Configure Code Formatting with Prettier
Consistent code formatting improves readability and reduces merge conflicts.

*   **Action:** Create `frontend/prettier.config.js`.
*   **Contents:**
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      semi: true,
      singleQuote: true,
      trailingComma: 'all',
    };
    ```
*   **Action:** Add a format script to `package.json`.
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      ...
      "format": "prettier --write ."
    },
    ```

### 4. Configure Path Aliases
Using path aliases simplifies imports and makes the project structure cleaner.

*   **Action:** Update `frontend/tsconfig.json` with path aliases.
*   **Contents:**
    ```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        ...
        "baseUrl": ".",
        "paths": {
          "@/*": ["src/*"]
        }
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

### 5. Integrate Vercel AI SDK UI Components
To build a rich, interactive chat experience, we will leverage the Vercel AI SDK's UI components and hooks. These components are built on `shadcn/ui` and will integrate seamlessly with our existing UI.

*   **Confirmation:** The `ai` package from the Vercel AI SDK is already listed as a dependency.
*   **Action:** Utilize the `useChat` hook for managing chat state, user input, and message history.
*   **Action:** Implement pre-built "AI Elements" for the chat interface. This includes:
    *   `Chat` for the main chat container.
    *   `Message` for displaying individual messages.
    *   `ChatPanel` for the user input area.
*   **Action:** Ensure that the styling of these components is consistent with the existing `shadcn-ui` theme. This may involve customizing the components or adjusting the Tailwind CSS configuration.

## Expected Outcome
After implementing these changes, the frontend project will be well-documented, consistently formatted, and easier to navigate. This will provide a solid foundation for building out the user interface.
