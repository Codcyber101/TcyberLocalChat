# OpenSpec Change Proposal: Replace Frontend with Vercel AI SDK AI Elements

## Title
Replace Frontend with Vercel AI SDK AI Elements

## Description
This proposal outlines a plan to rebuild the frontend of the TcyberChatbot application using the official Vercel AI SDK AI Elements. This will improve maintainability, reduce the amount of custom code, and allow us to fully leverage the power and features of the Vercel AI SDK.

## Analysis of Current Frontend
The current frontend is a Next.js application with the following key features:

*   **Chat Interface:** A chat window built with custom components that are inspired by the Vercel AI SDK.
*   **Top Bar:** A navigation bar with controls for chat history, document management, new chat, export/import, theme toggling, and settings.
*   **Drawers:** Side drawers for displaying chat history and managing documents.
*   **Styling:** The application is styled with `tailwindcss` and `shadcn/ui`.

While functional, the current implementation relies on custom-built components that mimic the behavior of the Vercel AI SDK. By migrating to the official AI Elements, we can simplify the codebase and ensure we are using the most up-to-date and feature-rich components.

## Proposed Plan

### 1. Project Setup
We will start by setting up a new Next.js project to ensure a clean environment.

*   **Action:** Create a new Next.js application.
*   **Action:** Install the following dependencies:
    *   `ai`
    *   `@ai-sdk/react`
    *   `@ai-sdk/react-ui`
    *   `shadcn-ui`
    *   `tailwindcss`
    *   Other necessary dependencies from the existing project.
*   **Action:** Configure `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, and `components.json` for `shadcn-ui`.

### 2. Component Replacement
The core of this proposal is to replace the custom chat components with the official AI Elements.

*   **Action:** Replace the existing chat components with `<Conversation />`, `<Message />`, and `<PromptInput />` from `@ai-sdk/react-ui`.
*   **Action:** Utilize the `useChat` hook from `@ai-sdk/react` to manage the chat state, user input, and message history.

### 3. Feature Implementation
We will re-implement the existing features using the new components and libraries.

*   **Action:** Re-implement the top bar, including all its functionalities.
*   **Action:** Re-implement the chat history and document management drawers. We will use `shadcn-ui`'s `Sheet` component for this.
*   **Action:** Re-implement the export/import functionality.
*   **Action:** Re-implement the theme toggle for light/dark/system modes.
*   **Action:** Re-implement the settings panel.

### 4. Styling
We will ensure the new frontend matches the existing application's visual style.

*   **Action:** Style the new AI Elements and `shadcn-ui` components using `tailwindcss` to match the current theme.

## Expected Outcome
Upon completion of this proposal, we will have a new frontend that is:

*   **More Robust:** Built on top of the official, well-tested Vercel AI SDK components.
*   **Easier to Maintain:** With a smaller, more standardized codebase.
*   **More Feature-Rich:** Able to take advantage of the latest features from the Vercel AI SDK.
