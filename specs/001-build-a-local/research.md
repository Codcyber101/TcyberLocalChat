# Research Findings: Build a Local First Chatbot

## Language and Framework Choices

### Decision: Python 3.11 for backend, React 18 for frontend
**Rationale**: Python has the most mature ecosystem for AI/ML workloads with extensive libraries. FastAPI provides high-performance async APIs with automatic OpenAPI generation. React maintains component-based architecture for the frontend. Python 3.11 offers excellent performance and modern language features.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Node.js with Express + React: Good for full-stack JavaScript, but Python superior for AI inference
- Go with Gin + React: High performance, but smaller AI ecosystem
- Rust with Axum + React: Excellent performance and safety, but complex for rapid development

## AI Model and Local Inference

### Decision: Multi-modal stack with LLaVA for image analysis, Whisper for audio transcription, LangChain RAG for text, sentence-transformers for embeddings, Ollama Llama 3.1 8B for generation
**Rationale**: LLaVA enables local image/diagram understanding without cloud services. Whisper provides accurate local audio transcription. Combined with LangChain RAG and sentence-transformers, this creates a comprehensive multi-modal AI pipeline that processes text, images, and audio locally while maintaining privacy and performance.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct Ollama API: Simple but lacks multi-modal capabilities
- LlamaIndex: Good alternative to LangChain, but LangChain has larger ecosystem
- OpenAI embeddings/models: Rejected due to local-first requirement
- Cloud multi-modal APIs: Rejected due to internet dependency and privacy concerns

## Document Processing

### Decision: Support PDF, TXT, and MD formats with max 50MB file size
**Rationale**: PDF is most common document format, TXT for simple text, MD for structured content. 50MB allows reasonable document sizes while preventing resource abuse. Libraries like pdf-parse and mammoth.js can handle extraction.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Only TXT: Too limiting for real-world usage
- DOCX support: Considered but adds complexity with mammoth.js dependency
- Unlimited size: Rejected for memory and performance constraints

## Storage Strategy

### Decision: Local file system for documents, SQLAlchemy with SQLite for metadata, ChromaDB for embeddings
**Rationale**: File system for document storage maintains local-first approach. SQLAlchemy provides robust ORM layer for Python with SQLite as the file-based database backend. ChromaDB handles vector storage for RAG. SQLAlchemy enables type-safe database operations and migrations.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct SQLite: More verbose than SQLAlchemy ORM
- Peewee ORM: Simpler but less feature-rich than SQLAlchemy
- FAISS for vectors: Good performance but requires more setup than ChromaDB
- PostgreSQL with pgvector: Requires database server setup
- Flat files with JSON: No relational capabilities

## Testing Framework

### Decision: pytest for backend, Jest for frontend, requests for API testing
**Rationale**: pytest is the standard for Python testing with excellent async support for FastAPI. Jest handles React component testing. requests library provides simple API contract testing. All align with Test-First principle.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- unittest (Python standard): More verbose than pytest
- Mocha + Chai for frontend: Less integrated with React ecosystem
- Cypress for E2E: Overkill for initial implementation

## Performance Benchmarks

### Decision: Chat <2s, Summarization <10s, implement caching and async processing
**Rationale**: Core interactions need to be fast. Implement Redis-like in-memory caching for frequent queries. Background processing for document operations prevents UI blocking. Monitor resources to prevent memory issues with large document sets.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Stricter limits (1s chat): May require expensive optimization prematurely
- Looser limits (5s chat): Poor user experience
- No caching: Slower repeated queries
- Synchronous processing: Poor UX during document operations

## Security Considerations

### Decision: Input validation, file type verification, no external network calls
**Rationale**: Prevent malicious file uploads through type checking and size limits. Sanitize all inputs. Local-first ensures no data leakage.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Antivirus scanning: Adds complexity, may not be necessary for local files
- Sandboxing: Overkill for initial version
- Encryption: Not required for local storage

## Deployment Strategy

### Decision: Local web server with auto-start script
**Rationale**: Simple npm/yarn start command launches both frontend and backend. No complex deployment needed for local-first app.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Electron app: Better desktop integration but adds build complexity
- Docker: Unnecessary for local deployment
- Static hosting: Not suitable for backend AI processing
