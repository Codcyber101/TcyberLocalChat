# Feature Specification: Build a Local First Chatbot

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-local`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "build a local first chatbot to interact with and without uploded document from the user for summarization, chat and other interactions"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to interact with a local chatbot that can summarize documents I upload and engage in general chat, all without requiring internet connectivity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no document is uploaded, **When** the user types and sends a message in the chat interface, **Then** the chatbot streams a relevant response with typing indicators.
2. **Given** a document is uploaded via the document management panel, **When** the user requests summarization, **Then** the chatbot provides a summary with streaming display.
3. **Given** a document is uploaded, **When** the user asks questions in the chat interface, **Then** the chatbot responds based on document content with source references.
4. **Given** multiple conversations exist, **When** the user switches between chats in the history panel, **Then** the interface updates to show the selected conversation.
5. **Given** documents are uploaded, **When** the user views the document list, **Then** status indicators show processing/embeddings/upload states.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the uploaded document is too large? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum file size limit]
- How does the system handle unsupported file types? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: supported document formats]
- What if multiple documents are uploaded?
