# Feature Specification: Responsive Frontend UI

**Feature Branch**: `002-design-and-develop`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Design and develop a responsive frontend UI, incorporating the following detailed components and functionalities:

**1. Collapsible Sidebar:**
    *   **Toggle Mechanism:** Implement a smooth, animated collapse/expand functionality.
    *   **New Chat Button:** Clearly visible button to initiate a new conversation, clearing the current chat context.
    *   **Chat Search:** An input field with real-time filtering capabilities to search through chat history by keywords.
    *   **Chat History:** A scrollable list displaying recent and saved chat sessions, each with a title/summary and timestamp, allowing users to resume conversations.
    *   **Document Management:** A section or dedicated tab within the sidebar to view, upload, organize, and manage documents previously uploaded or referenced in chats, with options for filtering and sorting.

**2. Top Bar (Right-aligned):**
    *   **Export/Import Functionality:** Buttons to export chat transcripts (e.g., JSON, PDF, TXT) and import previously exported chat data or settings.
    *   **Settings Panel:** A modal or dropdown accessible via an icon, containing:
        *   **Model Selection:** A dropdown or radio button group to choose between different AI models (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, custom models).
        *   **Theme Toggle:** A switch or button for dark/light mode selection.
        *   **Other Configurations:** Placeholder for additional user preferences such as notification settings, language selection, API key management, or default behaviors.

**3. Main Chat Interface Area:**
    *   **Chat Bubbles:**
        *   **User Messages:** Distinctly styled bubbles for user input.
        *   **AI Responses:** Distinctly styled bubbles for AI output, potentially with a different background color or avatar.
        *   **Citations:** Integrate a mechanism to display citations (e.g., numbered links) within AI responses, linking to relevant sections of uploaded documents or web search results.
        *   **Document Chat Integration:** Clearly indicate when AI responses are directly referencing or summarizing content from uploaded documents.
        *   **Interactive Elements:** Consider adding copy-to-clipboard, regenerate response, or feedback (thumbs up/down) options on AI messages.
    *   **Chat Message Input Area:**
        *   **Text Input Field:** A multi-line, resizable text area for typing messages.
        *   **Drag and Drop File/Document Upload:** Implement a visual indicator and functionality for users to drag and drop files directly into the input area for upload.
        *   **Send Button:** A prominent button to submit the message, active only when there is input.
        *   **Web Search Button:** An icon/button that, when toggled or clicked, instructs the AI to perform a web search as part of its response generation.
        *   **Attachment Button:** An icon/button to open a file browser for selecting and uploading multiple files/documents, with a preview of attached files before sending.

**General UI/UX Considerations:**
*   Ensure a clean, intuitive, and modern design aesthetic.
*   Implement responsive design principles for optimal viewing across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   Prioritize accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
*   Provide clear visual feedback for user actions (e.g., loading states, successful uploads, error messages).
*   Utilize consistent typography, color schemes, and iconography."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
    ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
    ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
    ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
    ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
    ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
    ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
    ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
    ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
    - User types and permissions
    - Data retention/deletion policies
    - Performance targets and scale
    - Error handling behaviors
    - Integration requirements
    - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the local chatbot application, I want to interact with an AI assistant through a responsive web interface that allows me to manage conversations, upload documents, and access settings easily, so that I can have productive conversations and manage my data efficiently across different devices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user is on the main chat interface, **When** they click the sidebar toggle, **Then** the sidebar smoothly collapses or expands with animation.
2. **Given** the user wants to start a new conversation, **When** they click the "New Chat" button in the sidebar, **Then** the current chat context is cleared and a new conversation begins.
3. **Given** the user has multiple chat sessions, **When** they type in the chat search field, **Then** the chat history list filters in real-time to show matching sessions.
4. **Given** the user has uploaded documents, **When** they access the document management section, **Then** they can view, sort, and filter their documents.
5. **Given** the user wants to export chat data, **When** they click the export button in the top bar, **Then** they can choose format (JSON, PDF, TXT) and download the transcript.
6. **Given** the user wants to change AI model, **When** they open the settings panel, **Then** they can select from available models in a dropdown.
7. **Given** the user prefers dark mode, **When** they toggle the theme switch, **Then** the entire interface switches to dark theme.
8. **Given** the user is typing a message, **When** they drag a file into the input area, **Then** the file is visually indicated and uploaded.
9. **Given** the user wants to search the web, **When** they click the web search button, **Then** the next AI response includes web search results.
10. **Given** the AI responds with citations, **When** the user clicks a citation link, **Then** they are directed to the relevant document section.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user tries to upload a file that exceeds size limits?
- How does the interface behave on very small screens (mobile) with the sidebar collapsed?
- What if the user has no internet connection for web search?
- How are accessibility features (screen readers, keyboard navigation) implemented for all interactive elements?
- What loading states and error messages are shown during file uploads or AI responses?
