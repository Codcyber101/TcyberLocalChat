# Implementation Plan: Responsive Frontend UI

**Branch**: `002-design-and-develop` | **Date**: 2025-09-24 | **Spec**: specs/002-design-and-develop/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from specs/002-design-and-develop/spec.md

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
    → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
    → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
    → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
    → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
    → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
    → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
    → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
    → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
    → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Build a responsive frontend UI for the local chatbot application using Next.js 14+, shadcn/UI components, and Tailwind CSS. Implement collapsible sidebar for navigation and document management, top bar with export/import and settings, main chat interface with drag-and-drop uploads, citations, and interactive elements. Ensure accessibility, performance, and consistent UX across devices.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript, Next.js 14+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14+, React 18+, shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (icons), Vercel AI SDK (for streaming AI responses)  
**Storage**: Browser localStorage for user settings, API calls for chat data and documents  
**Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) on desktop, tablet, mobile  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)  
**Performance Goals**: <100ms UI interaction response, <2s initial page load, <500ms API response display  
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, mobile-first responsive design, offline-capable settings  
**Scale/Scope**: ~50 components, single-page application with real-time chat streaming

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Code Quality Principle**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint configuration, consistent Tailwind CSS classes, modular component architecture.  
**Testing Standards Principle**: 80%+ test coverage with Jest/React Testing Library, E2E tests with Playwright for critical user flows.  
**User Experience Consistency Principle**: shadcn/UI design system for consistent components, Tailwind for responsive layouts, ARIA attributes for accessibility.  
**Performance Requirements Principle**: Code splitting, lazy loading, optimized re-renders with React.memo, efficient API polling/streaming.

No violations detected. Design aligns with all constitutional principles.

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 - Web application with separate frontend and backend directories, since backend already exists and frontend will integrate via API calls.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
    - None identified - all technical choices provided in arguments

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
    ```
    For each technology choice:
      Task: "Research best practices for Next.js 14+ with shadcn/UI for chat applications"
      Task: "Research Tailwind CSS responsive design patterns for multi-device chat UI"
      Task: "Research accessibility patterns for chat interfaces with citations"
    ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
    - Decision: Use Next.js App Router with server/client components
    - Rationale: Better performance for streaming chat responses
    - Alternatives considered: Pages Router (simpler but less optimized)

**Output**: research.md with research findings

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
    - ChatSession: id, title, summary, timestamp, messageCount
    - Message: id, content, timestamp, type (user|ai), conversationId, citations
    - Document: id, filename, size, mimeType, uploadDate, status
    - UserSettings: theme, selectedModel, notifications, apiKeys
    - Validation rules: required fields, type constraints

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
    - GET /api/chat/conversations - List conversations
    - POST /api/chat/ - Send message, receive streaming response
    - POST /api/documents/upload - Upload document
    - GET /api/documents/ - List documents
    - POST /api/data-management/export - Export data
    - Use OpenAPI 3.0 schema format
    - Output to `/contracts/` directory

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
    - One test file per endpoint with mock responses
    - Assert request/response schemas
    - Tests must fail (no backend implementation in frontend)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
    - Chat interface loading and sidebar toggle
    - Message sending with file upload
    - Settings panel interactions
    - Export/import functionality

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
    - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType roo`
      **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
    - Add Next.js, shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS to tech stack
    - Preserve existing backend context
    - Update recent changes

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → API client creation task [P]
- Each component → component creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to connect components to API

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: API clients → components → pages → integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent components)

**Estimated Output**: 40-50 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No violations - design is within constitutional bounds.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
