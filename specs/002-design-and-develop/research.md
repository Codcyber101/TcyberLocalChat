# Research Findings: Responsive Frontend UI

## Next.js 14+ with shadcn/UI for Chat Applications

- **Decision**: Use Next.js 14 App Router with server/client components architecture
- **Rationale**: App Router provides better performance for streaming chat responses, built-in server components for SEO, and improved developer experience. Server components can handle initial data fetching while client components manage interactive chat features.
- **Alternatives considered**: Pages Router (simpler but less optimized for real-time features), Vite + React (faster dev server but less production-ready features)

## Tailwind CSS Responsive Design Patterns

- **Decision**: Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind's responsive prefixes and container queries
- **Rationale**: Ensures consistent experience across devices, prioritizes mobile UX as primary. Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints with mobile-first approach. Container queries for component-level responsiveness.
- **Alternatives considered**: CSS Grid/Flexbox only (less maintainable), CSS-in-JS solutions (adds bundle size)

## Accessibility Patterns for Chat Interfaces

- **Decision**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Rationale**: Chat interfaces require special accessibility considerations for citations, real-time content updates, and complex interactions. Use `role="log"` for chat areas, `aria-live` for new messages, and proper heading hierarchy.
- **Alternatives considered**: Basic ARIA (insufficient for complex chat UX), custom accessibility layer (adds complexity)

## shadcn/UI Component Integration

- **Decision**: Use shadcn/UI as the primary component library with Tailwind CSS
- **Rationale**: Provides accessible, customizable components that follow design system principles. Easy to extend and theme. Includes dialog, sheet, and other components needed for settings panels and document viewers.
- **Alternatives considered**: Material-UI (heavier bundle), Ant Design (less flexible theming)

## Real-time Chat Streaming

- **Decision**: Use Vercel AI SDK with Server-Sent Events for streaming responses
- **Rationale**: Provides seamless streaming experience, handles connection management, and integrates well with Next.js. Supports citations and metadata in streaming responses.
- **Alternatives considered**: WebSockets (more complex), polling (poor UX)

## File Upload and Drag-and-Drop

- **Decision**: HTML5 Drag and Drop API with progress indicators and preview
- **Rationale**: Native browser APIs provide best performance and accessibility. Include visual feedback, file type validation, and size limits.
- **Alternatives considered**: Third-party libraries (adds dependencies), basic file input (poor UX)

## Citation Display and Document Linking

- **Decision**: Inline superscript numbers with tooltip previews and expandable document viewer
- **Rationale**: Balances information density with usability. Citations link to specific sections when available, with fallback to document viewer.
- **Alternatives considered**: Footnotes (disrupts reading flow), modal overlays (breaks context)

## Theme Management

- **Decision**: CSS custom properties with Tailwind's dark mode and shadcn/UI theming system
- **Rationale**: Allows runtime theme switching without full page reload. Supports system preference detection and manual override.
- **Alternatives considered**: Separate CSS files (slower switching), CSS-in-JS themes (bundle impact)

## Performance Optimizations

- **Decision**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and React.memo for component optimization
- **Rationale**: Chat applications can have many messages; virtualization for long conversations. Lazy load heavy components like document viewers.
- **Alternatives considered**: No optimization (poor performance), over-optimization (complexity)

## Testing Strategy

- **Decision**: Jest + React Testing Library for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E
- **Rationale**: RTL focuses on user behavior testing, Playwright handles real browser interactions. Critical for accessibility and responsive design testing.
- **Alternatives considered**: Cypress (slower), Testing Library only (misses E2E coverage)
