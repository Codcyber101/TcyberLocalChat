# Feature Specification: UI Polish and Feature Enhancements

**Feature Branch**: `004-polish-the-ui`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Polish the UI with additional feature enhancements. Fix sidebar toggle not working properly, make settings panel clickable with model selector for local Ollama models and cloud fallback models, dark/light theme mode and other preferences, fix export and import feature, add logo and name to the chatbot on the far left corner, add buttons on the chat/message input for multimodal chat (mic for audio) and web search"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: What audio format should be used for recording (WebM, WAV, MP3) and how should the recorded audio be processed before sending to the backend transcription service? ‚Üí A: Audio mic is for multimodal/audio chat with the multimodal LLM, not just for recording
- Q: Which web search API provider should be used (Google Custom Search, Bing Web Search, DuckDuckGo Instant Answer) and what are the fallback options if the primary provider fails? ‚Üí A: Web search capability should be controlled on the setting with enable/disable toggle and use the DuckDuckGo Instant
- Q: How should theme preferences be persisted - in browser localStorage only, or also synchronized with user account settings if implemented later? ‚Üí A: In all
- Q: What specific data should be included in exports - conversations only, or also documents, settings, and chat history metadata? ‚Üí A: C
- Q: When a user switches AI models mid-conversation, should the new model have access to the existing conversation context, or should it start fresh? ‚Üí A: A

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a chatbot user, I want a polished, intuitive interface with working navigation, accessible settings, and enhanced input capabilities so that I can efficiently manage my conversations and preferences while having access to multimodal features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the chatbot interface, **When** they click the sidebar toggle button, **Then** the sidebar should expand/collapse smoothly without visual glitches
2. **Given** a user wants to change AI models, **When** they click the settings panel, **Then** they should see model selection options for local Ollama models and cloud fallback models
3. **Given** a user wants to change theme, **When** they access settings, **Then** they should be able to toggle between dark and light themes and preferences should persist in browser storage
4. **Given** a user wants to export their data, **When** they use the export feature, **Then** all data including conversations, documents, settings, and cached content should be exported successfully
5. **Given** a user wants to import data, **When** they use the import feature, **Then** their previously exported data should be imported correctly
6. **Given** a user wants to use multimodal audio chat, **When** they click the microphone button in the input area, **Then** audio input should be captured and sent directly to the multimodal LLM for processing
7. **Given** a user has enabled web search in settings and wants to search the web, **When** they click the web search button in the input area, **Then** DuckDuckGo instant search functionality should be activated
8. **Given** a user switches AI models mid-conversation, **When** the new model responds, **Then** it should maintain access to the full conversation context

### Edge Cases
- What happens when sidebar toggle is clicked rapidly multiple times?
- How does the interface handle when audio recording fails due to permissions?
- What happens when export/import operations are interrupted?
- How does the UI behave when model switching is in progress?
- What happens when theme changes are made during an active conversation?
- What happens when web search is disabled in settings but user tries to use it?
- How does the system handle when conversation context becomes too large during model switching?
